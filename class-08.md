## Layout:
CSS deals with every element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a 
- **block-level box** :start on a new line Examples include: **h1 , p , ul , li** .

or an
 - **inline box** :flow in between surrounding text Examples include: **img , b , i .

**Controll ing the Position of Elements**.

 - **Normal flow**: In normal flow, each block-level element sits on top of the next one(**position:static**)
 - **Relative Positioning**: moves an element in relation to where it would have been in normal flow(**position:relative**)
 - **Ab solute positioning**: When the position property is given a value of absolute, the box is taken out of normal
flow and no longer affects the position of other elements on the page.(**position:absolute**)
 - **Fixed Positioning** :Fixed positioning is a type of absolute positioning that requires the position property to have a value of fixed.(**position:fixed**)
 - **Floating Elements**: The float property allows you to take an element in normal flow and place it as far to the
left or right of the containing element as possible(**Float**)
