**we can creat a table in HTML by useing opening and closing (table) tag**

**any table made up by:**
- **rows**: with opening and closing **tr**
- **table data**: with opening and closing **td** or **th**
  - **th** : table  header

**we can do a lot of changes on the table itself** like:
- **Spanning ColumnS** : when you want the entries in a table to stretch across more than one column. 
-**Spanning Rows** : when You want entries in a table to stretch down across more than one row.
-**Long Tables** : in the table we use **thaed** (table haed) and **tbody** (table body) and **tfoot** (table foot).
